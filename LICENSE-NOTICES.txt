NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE. NO 
ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY WIND RIVER, ITS DEALERS, 
DISTRIBUTORS, AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES SHALL IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS 
WARRANTY. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of implied 
warranties or how long an implied warranty may last, so the above limitations 
may not apply to Customer. This warranty gives Customer specific legal rights 
and Customer may have other rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. 

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: WIND RIVER AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR 
ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OF ANY KIND

IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER 
LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, 
EVEN IF WIND RIVER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO 
EVENT WILL WIND RIVER'S AGGREGATE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING 
OUT OF OR RELATED TO OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). 
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or 
consequential damages so this limitation and exclusion may not apply to 
Customer. 

THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITED LIABILITY ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE 
BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN WIND RIVER AND CUSTOMER. WIND RIVER WOULD NOT BE 
ABLE TO PROVIDE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS.
